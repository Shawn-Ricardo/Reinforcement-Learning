In the follwing notebook, I use OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car environment to show how to deal with a continous space. 

This work follows my work on SARSA algorithms, which deal only in discrete spaces.

The Mountain Car environment has a continous state space and a discrete action space. By discretizing the state space, I can apply a SARSA style (in this case, Q-Learning) reinformcement learning algorithm to teach an agent to climb a mountain!
