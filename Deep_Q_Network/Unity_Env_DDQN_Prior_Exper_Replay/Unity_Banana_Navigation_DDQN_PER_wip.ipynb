Users can train agents on images from this high-fidelity environment, can recieve a state vector (as in this example), or a combination of both.\n",

    "### 4. Replay Buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "Mnih et al. implemented a Replay Buffer to address several issues present with standard online Q-Learning applied to this environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Each step of experience is potentially used in several update steps. This experience tuple can be a rare occurance/edge case and thus the agent can learn from these cases more often without having to rely on the hope of experiencing the rare occurance in the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) There are strong correlations between consequtive frames in this environment. That is to say, an action at time step T will affect the state at timestep T+1, which in turn affects the state at timestep T+2, and so on. An agent that relies solely on sequential learning runs the risk of being stuck in a local minimum or divering catastrophically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Decoupling \n",
    "\n",
    "3) When learning sequentially and on-policy (weights are updating every iteration), the current parameters determine the next data sample that these same parameters are trained on. This is the literal equivalent of aiming at a moving target. Replay Buffers allow a decoupling between the target and the parameters that are being changed to obtain this target when weights are kept fixed over N number of iterations. This concept is known as a Fixed Q-Target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, having a replay buffer than contains prior experiences and learns from these experiences only after a certain number of iterations addresses the most salient issues present when adapting Q-Learning for this application. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Prioritized Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Schaul et al. introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) in order to prioritize which transitions are replayed. The approach has proven to make experience replay more efficient and effective than if all transitions are replay uniformly; which was the method implemented in Mnih et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sumtree is used to implement PER. Please review the readme of this directory to better understand how Schaul et al. utilized this approach.\n",
