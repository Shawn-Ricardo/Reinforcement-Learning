In 2016, Schaul, et al. developed a framework for prioritizing experience, so as to replay important transitions more frequently. The algorithm was presented in the paper, ["Prioritized Experience Replay"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf).

The algorithm is an improvement over the method titled Experience Replay, by Mnih et al., discussed and implemented elsewhere in this GitHub.
